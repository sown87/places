<meta name="twitter:description" content="Hi, my name is Shawn, and this is a simple travel blog site. It&rsquo;s meant to capture observations of the places that my wife Shondy and I visited as we traveled by car around the United States during the pandemic years of 2020 and 2021. However, it also includes some trails and backcountry areas I hiked as side-trips where we had extended stays.

<p>This blog site is achieved courtesy of several neat, modern technologies that make running your own static website easy.  So to give credit where credit is due:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://gohugo.io" target="_blank">Hugo Static Site Generator</a> which is super easy to use.  Having this site simply be creation/edits of Markdown files can&rsquo;t be any more straightforward</li>
<li>The Hugo theme <code>I am Sam</code> courtesy of <a href="https://victoria.dev" target="_blank">Victoria Drake</a> and <em>(in her own words)</em> her lovely team of <a href="https://github.com/victoriadrake/hugo-theme-sam/graphs/contributors" target="_blank">contributors</a>. All the heavy lifting for the <em>look-and-feel</em> of this site comes from their work.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com" target="_blank">GitHub</a> and <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/about-github-pages" target="_blank">GitHub Pages</a> where this site is hosted and built.</li>
</ul>
<p>Finally, I purpose this site as a hobby for the enjoyment of friends and family&ndash; and anyone who discovers this site browsing the internet&ndash; without the use of social media.  So there are no ads, endorsements, request for funding, login, or privileged content on any page.</p>
