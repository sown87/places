      <description>For all our shared photos while in Idaho, see our Photo Gallery at /places/gallery/id Try, Try Again When we first visited here last fall (see previous post here ), we didn&amp;rsquo;t feel like we got a good-enough look around the area. Winter was setting in alongside COVID, and it made getting out a bit tough.
So we opted for a second visit. This time, we secured an AirBnB apartment in the highly desirable and eclectic north-end Boise neighborhood.</description>

      <description>For all our shared photos while in Idaho, see our Photo Gallery at /places/gallery/id Wait.. this is Idaho?!? Until we crossed the Snake River driving from Oregon along Interstate 84, I had never been to Idaho. It was the second week of November, 2020, and the weather was borderline snow with ice laden clouds overhead, ready to burst.
That snow part&amp;ndash; yep, I expected that. Along with snow, the picture I had in my head of Idaho was a place of tall mountains, pine forests, rivers running free, clean air, no crowds, bears walking across the road from time-to-time.</description>
