<h2 id="oh-lord-when-will-winter-be-over">&ldquo;Oh Lord, When will Winter be Over?&rdquo;</h2>
<p>We arrived in Arvada, Colorado, a suburb of Denver, the second week of March 2021 for a month-long stay.  I was excited.  We were visiting family in the area, and I was told the weather was looking nice.   Spring was coming.  Hooray!  Since November, we&rsquo;d been bearing through cold and snow and ice traveling in Oregon, Idaho, Utah, Arizona (yes, Arizona had snow, see my blog post <a href="/posts/cochiseco-az/">here</a> ), Texas, and Arkansas.  Great times, but I was ready for a little warmth and sun.</p>
<p><img src="/gallery/co/co_50.jpg" alt="snowshoes"></p>
<p>Nope.</p>
<p>As with our snow-filled stay in Conway, Arkansas (see blog post <a href="/posts/conway-ar/">here</a>, the Denver area got hit with a <a href="https://www.weather5280.com/2021/03/15/blizzard-of-march-2021-will-stand-as-4th-biggest-snowfall-on-record-for-denver-final-update-and-snowfall-totals" target="_blank">once-every-twenty-year blizzard</a> shortly
after we arrived.  Aaarrgh!  I got good at shoveling snow&ndash; something I did several times during our stay.  I remember being outside with
the storm in full-swing, chillin' <em>(literally)</em> with the other guys in the neighbor of our AirBnB house, all of us shoveling snow off the
sidewalks and driveways.  I heard one neighbor say <em>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t seen a snowstorm like this since that bad one back in 2003&hellip;&quot;</em>.</p>
<p>Yikes.  More winter weather. Here we go again.</p>
<p><img src="/gallery/co/co_2.jpg" alt="bigsnow"></p>
<h2 id="zoom-fatigue-and-covid">Zoom Fatigue and COVID</h2>
<p>By the time we got to Arvada, it was our sixth month on the road.  And COVID was still bad, so we maintained a careful posture wearing masks whenever in public, and limiting indoor public activities to just shopping.  And with being in midst of fall/winter that usually incurs some sickness, we kept playing it safe.  Honestly, our face-face human interaction was, over the course of our travels, very infrequent and cautious.</p>
<p>Sure, the online human interaction helped.  I had been teleworking the entire time&ndash; 9 hours a day in front of a computer.  Lots of meetings and conversation with people.  Shondy and I were being COVID-careful and just attending local churches online.  I kept friendships going <em>(and my sanity)</em> by participating with my Zoom-based Bible Study with several other terrific guys back in California.   Plus, there was Google Duo or Skype or Facetime with our kids and family and friends often. And of course, Shondy and I watched some TV.</p>
<p>By now, though, my eyes were glazing over from all the screentime.  That screentime during COVID picked up it&rsquo;s own moniker&ndash; <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zoom_fatigue" target="_blank">Zoom Fatigue</a></p>
<p>But our time in Arvada would always be remembered as the moment we <strong>broke the ice</strong> on Zoom Fatigue
<em>(BTW&ndash; get it, ice, cold outside, snowy? A pugn, just in case you didn&rsquo;t pick up on my bad humor ;-)</em></p>
<h2 id="family-friends-and-human-interaction-aka-a-party">Family, Friends and Human Interaction (a.k.a., &ldquo;A Party&rdquo;)</h2>
<p>After COVID hit&ndash; but before we left California&ndash; we ended up joining a Zoom-based Christian marriage class through <a href="https://www.denverunited.com/" target="_blank">Denver United Church</a>.  The class met weekly on Wednesday evenings, and was attended by couples from a wide range of experience&ndash; from just newly married to marriages still going after a few decades.  The class was heavan-sent for everyone.  We shared our COVID-enduced struggles&ndash;  losing work, missing Sunday church services, educating kids who can&rsquo;t attend school, coping with loved ones who caught coronavirus.  The class was only supposed to last 6 weeks, but everyone enjoyed it so much we kept going.  Shondy and I were the only ones not living within the Denver metropolitan area.   For us, though, it was a huge blessing to have connection with other couples as we carried on our road trip.</p>
<p>Well, the group planned a face-face gathering once we arrived in Arvada.  Donning masks and some yummy potluck items, we all got together one cold, snowy Sunday in an apartment complex community room near downtown Denver.  It was the first time most of us met face-to-face&ndash; not just Shondy and I, but several others hadn&rsquo;t met in person either.   So we celebrated!  We ate too much, talked, laughed, shot pool, and prayed together.   I wished I had an hour to spend with each person.</p>
<p>It was the first time we had attended a party in months.  God knows &ndash; it felt great.  I really didn&rsquo;t want it to end.</p>
<p>I had another moment like that a few days earlier while shoveling snow.  My neighbor across the street was shoveling the sidewalk a certain way&ndash; piling snow in the yard, or on the street against the curb.   Curious, I went across the street and asked him why.   He described how it&rsquo;s expected for each homeowner to keep the sidewalks clear, and the city of Arvada will plough the street.  And how shoveling during or right after a snow is better, before it gets packed and icy in days ahead when clearing it will be harder. I had no clue about any of that.  We ended up talking for about 20min there, standing the in the street, just chatting.</p>
<p>I hadn&rsquo;t chatted with another guy for that long, face-to-face, in nearly six months.</p>
<p>Later that day, while I was teleworking, I looked on from our AirBnB across the street &ndash; he was clearing snow not only for his house, but for the elderly lady next door, so she could get her car out of the driveway.   The man&rsquo;s a saint.   Shondy and I figured he needed a thank you&hellip; so we gifted him and his girlfriend a six-pack of beer and some chocolate for his kindness.</p>
<p>And the next time I shoveled snow, I took extra pains to clear some area for my next door neighbor, too.</p>
<h2 id="snowshoeing-in-golden-gate-canyon-state-park">Snowshoeing in Golden Gate Canyon State Park</h2>
<p>Being from California, I have never snowshoed.   But on the encouragement of one of my friends in our Denver United marriage class, that changed.  The two of us ventured forth, on snowshoes, in <a href="https://www.colorado.com/state-parks/golden-gate-canyon-state-park" target="_blank">Golden Gate Canyon State Park</a> for a day hike in the Rockies.  Loved it!   We caught a sunny day between storms, and I&rsquo;m sure that made it a bit easier.  But weather aside, though, I&rsquo;m hooked on winter hiking.</p>
<p>I MUST do this again!  I MUST own snowshoes!</p>
<p>BTW, we used <a href="https://crescentmoonsnowshoes.com/" target="_blank">Crescent Moon Snowshoes</a> &ndash; a Colorado manufacturer&ndash; rented from this <a href="https://www.mountainsidegearrental.com/" target="_blank">outdoor gear shop</a>.  I highly recommend both.</p>
<p><img src="/gallery/co/co_40.jpg" alt="snowshoes"></p>
<h2 id="final-observations">Final Observations</h2>
<p>We needed body work done on our car while in Arvada, after the accident we had in Fayetteville, Arkansas (see blog post <a href="/posts/bentonville-ar/">here</a>).  We had to sort out with the insurance company the awkward details of being insured in California, rear-ended in Arkansas, but asking for repairs in Colorado.   But they were very friendly and cooperative, and I would be very happy using <a href="https://www.shelterinsurance.com/" target="_blank">this insurance company</a> again in the future.</p>
<p>Shondy and I had one evening where we bundled up, and walked a couple miles over to <a href="http://www.silvervineswinery.com/">Silver Vines Wine Tasting Room</a> in downtown Arvada.  It wasn&rsquo;t too cold&ndash; even seemed a bit warm.  Great!  This looked like a good evening for a date.  And it was.   We enjoyed the outside sidewalk seating area with other guests. The wine sampler and charcuterie board we ordered were great.  The wind was blowing east-erly and seemed pleaseant given the cold weather we&rsquo;d had to that point.  Then it happened &ndash; in a mere moment, the wind shifted west-erly, and the temps dropped like 15degF.  In like a minute.  I&rsquo;m not kidding.  That&rsquo;s Colorado for you.  Our 2mile walk back to the AirBnB was downright frigid.  And the next morning&ndash; 5 inches of snow on the ground.</p>
<p>This Argentin-ian <a href="https://quieroarepas.com/" target="_blank">tapas place</a> has some really tasty food.</p>
<p><img src="/gallery/co/co_41.jpg" alt="tapas"></p>
<p><a href="https://www.denver.org/about-denver/neighborhood-guides/washington-park/" target="_blank">Washington Park</a> <em>(or &lsquo;Wash&rsquo; Park, as the locals call it)</em> is a fabulous place to walk, bike, fish, play volleyball, or people watch.  We were there a couple times on the occasional sunny days we got.   Seemed like a place for young people to hang out and flirt ;-)</p>
