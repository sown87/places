<p>I could use all sorts of superlatives, and heap all sorts of praise, on how great Zion National Park is.  And it would all be true.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;d be articulating poorly what so many other writers, artists, outdoor enthusiasts, etc. have, in the past, stated better.  Instead, I&rsquo;ll let the photos speak for themselves.</p>
<p>I only leave the readers of this blog post with one command:  Go.</p>
<p>Go to Zion, and take in the amazement.  Put it on your bucket list.  Save your $$.  It will be worth it.</p>
<h2 id="other-observations">Other Observations</h2>
<p>I <em>tried</em> to make it all the way to Angel&rsquo;s Landing, but took a pass on that <em>hold-the-chain-at-the-edge-of-the-1500'-cliff</em> last 100 yards.   Yeah, it terrified me.  But so did all the 100&rsquo;s of tourists walking in sneakers on ice, trying it at the same time.  It was the weekend before Christmas 2020, and it was crowded.   All I could think about was slipping, or catching COVID from sharing the chain with the hundreds of people.</p>
<p>But I had all day, so I added the Emerald Pools trails to my adventure afterwards.   Fabulous time!</p>
