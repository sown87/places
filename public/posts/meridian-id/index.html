<h2 id="wait-this-is-idaho">Wait.. this is Idaho?!?</h2>
<p>Until we crossed the Snake River driving from Oregon along Interstate 84, I had never been to Idaho.  It was the second week of November, 2020, and the weather was borderline snow with ice laden clouds overhead, ready to burst.</p>
<p>That snow part&ndash; yep, I expected that.  Along with snow, the picture I had in my head of Idaho was a place of tall mountains, pine forests, rivers running free, clean air, no crowds, bears walking across the road from time-to-time.  You know, like what you would find featured in outdoor magazines.  Come to think of it, my impressions of Idaho all came from reading outdoor stuff.</p>
<p>But the snow part was the only thing that matched my brain-picture.   I didn&rsquo;t see mountains or forests.  Instead, it was farms and post-harvest onion fields.  And mostly flat highway to boot.  &ldquo;OK&rdquo;, I thought, &ldquo;let&rsquo;s drive on a bit further&rdquo;.</p>
<p>And as we neared Meridian, the fields gave way to office buildings and suburban stores&ndash; and lots of new home construction.   Idaho is becoming a MAJOR landing spot for expatriat Californian&rsquo;s fleeing the state, and geesh, no kidding!  The nearby cities of Caldwell and Nampa have alot of housing going up&hellip; it was obvious from the highway.   As we came closer to Meridian, I saw a backdrop of Boise Hills with a bit of snow on them, but our surburban environment nearby kept growing.</p>
<h2 id="getting-comfortable-in-meridian">Getting Comfortable in Meridian</h2>
<p>Now, I&rsquo;m not complaining.  We stayed in Meridian, Idaho for the remainder of November <em>(and celebrated Thanksgiving there)</em>. We very much enjoyed it.  The AirBnB we rented was indeed in a suburban area, in a nice neighborhood with lawns, a little walking path nearby, mature trees that were dropping leavees, and friendly neighbors.   I spent one afternoon raking leaves, just to look like one of the neighborhood gang.   Our AirBnB was comfortable, and our AirBnB host super nice.</p>
<p>It just wasn&rsquo;t the Idaho I imagined.  It seem more like Morgan Hill or Pleasanton or some other Bay Area suburb.</p>
<p>But in hindsite, it was a blessing.  Because it kept us warm&ndash; which turned out to be REALLY necessary&hellip;</p>
<h2 id="baby-its-cold-outside">Baby, It&rsquo;s Cold Outside!</h2>
<p>The snow came shortly after our arrival, the next morning.  And yeah&ndash; it was cold.  Idaho is known for getting cold, and though this was only the 20 degF range&ndash; certainly not extreme cold by Idaho standards&ndash; my Californian-bred internal core-temp wasn&rsquo;t having any of it.  Too cold for my routine of walking outside 1 hour each morning.  To be honest, though, this was due to something both my wife and had to admit&ndash; we didn&rsquo;t have any <strong>real</strong> cold-weather apparel.</p>
<p><img src="/places/gallery/id/id_01.jpg" alt="housesnow"></p>
<p>First line of business- get warm clothes.  Fortunately, the <a href="https://www.sierra.com/" target="_blank">online outdoor retailer I&amp;rsquo;ve loved and shopped at for years</a> has a physical store in Meridian, 2 miles from our AirBnB.  Even better:  it&rsquo;s right next to a <a href="https://www.wincofoods.com/" target="_blank">Winco</a>.  So donned our masks, and headed out to the malls.  We got our 0deg jackets and grocery shopping done in one fell swoop.</p>
<p>And that partly describes Meridian:  It&rsquo;s Idaho, but being a suburb in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boise_metropolitan_area" target="_blank">Boise Metropolitan Statistical area</a>, every modern amenity you need for comfortable living is right there.  So I say, to those sub-freezing temperatures that we faced all November: <strong>&ldquo;Take that, cold&rdquo;!</strong></p>
<h2 id="an-unexpected-adventure-in-wine-tasting---remote-idaho-style">An Unexpected Adventure in Wine Tasting - Remote Idaho-Style</h2>
<p>One Saturday morning, we decided to explore the town of Eagle, just north of Meridian.  We heard about a good <a href="https://www.perksoflife.com/" target="_blank">gluten-free bakery there</a>, and this <a href="https://onehautecookie.net/" target="_blank">other cleverly-named one</a>.  It wasn&rsquo;t snowing at the time, so decided to give &lsquo;em a try.</p>
<p>After our pastry/cookie fix, we opted to drive more.   We saw this road head north from Eagle, and decided, <em>&ldquo;Hey, let&rsquo;s just see how far this takes us!&quot;</em>.  I was curious about how long it would take to hit tree-line, as most of Treasure Valley was pretty grey/brown from where we&rsquo;d seen.  So we drove north.  And up.</p>
<p>But the road turned from paved to gravel to wet icy dirt and <strong>no</strong> buildings within about 3 miles.  Oh well, guess we have to turn around&ndash; don&rsquo;t want to get stuck if snow started. Then, we noticed a sign nearby:  <em>&ldquo;3 Horse Ranch Winery - Just Ahead&rdquo;</em>.</p>
<p>Cool!! Gluten-free pastries, and now wine!  What a stroke of blessing!  Of course, we had to push on to the winery.  We figured it couldn&rsquo;t be far&ndash; after all, we&rsquo;re on an icy dirt road.</p>
<p>Well, 7 miles and 45min later, through totally barren hills and another county, going like 15mph or slower, we arrived at <a href="https://www.3horseranchvineyards.com/" target="_blank">3 Horse Ranch</a>.  Seriously, this place is really the proverbial <em>&ldquo;middle of nowhere&rdquo;</em>.  But they were open for tasting, with outdoor seating too.  So we settled in <em>(chilly Idaho fashion, 4 layers + our winter coats)&quot;</em> at a table on the lawn, and enjoyed some high-altitude Idaho Malbec wine with Idaho gouda cheese and Elk salami.  I ended up chatting with the proprietor and wine-maker, who was from Napa, and talked about growing grapes in high, cold climates.  It was alot of unexpected fun!</p>

<h2 id="other-observations">Other Observations.</h2>
<p>We fell in love with the <a href="https://www.boise.coop/" target="_blank">Boise Co-op</a>, and shopped there often, as it was the one place we found fresh*-enough* green vegetables.</p>
<p>I barbecued cornish game hens and potatoes on the grill for Thanksgiving.  Shondy decorated our AirBnB.  It was festive, but only the two of us.  We missed being with our kids.</p>
<p>Yes, we ventured into the city of Boise a handful of times, and I managed a couple of long day hikes in the Boise foothills during our stay.  We need to come back to check out more of Boise, in a different season of year.  And post-COVID, &lsquo;cause alot of stuff was closed.</p>
<p>The whole Treasure Valley area was decked out for Christmas.  With the chilly, snowy weather, it actually <em>felt</em> like a White Christmas, something I really had no frame-of-reference for after living in Santa Cruz, California most of my life.  So I loved that.  Shondy and I took one evening and walked around the Christmas Light display at the <a href="https://idahobotanicalgarden.org/" target="_blank">Idaho Botantical Garden</a>.  To make it through that without frostbitten fingers, we each had our own pack of handwarmer&rsquo;s purchased earlier in the month from Sierra.  Those came in hand-y. ;-)</p>
