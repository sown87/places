<h2 id="friendly-people-fabulous-names">Friendly People, Fabulous Names</h2>
<p>OK, so right off the top, let me jump into a couple observations about Arkansas:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Friendly People</strong>.  Call it Southern courtesy, or simply good manners&ndash; whatever you want&ndash; but compared to Western states, it was very noticeable how friendly people are in Arkansas.   And it goes beyond the <em>&ldquo;yes ma&rsquo;am&rdquo;</em> or <em>&ldquo;yes sir&rdquo;</em> etiquette.  Folks in Arkansas look you in the eye.  If you&rsquo;re walking down a road and a car passes bye, it&rsquo;s expected that you wave at the driver, in a sorta <em>&ldquo;Howdy, have a good day!&quot;</em> kinda way. And they wave back.  We loved it.  At the AirBnb we stayed in, a solar panel salesman came to our door one day.  Politely, we had to beg off, letting him know it&rsquo;s a rental, and wouldn&rsquo;t buy anything.  His response? *&ldquo;Thank ya&rsquo;ll anyway.  Ya&rsquo;ll have a blessed day!&rdquo;.  Like he was so glad to have stopped by.  Wow.</li>
<li><strong>Fabulous Names</strong> - and I mean, names for <strong>places</strong>.   We actually didn&rsquo;t stay <em>in</em> Conway, but just a hop-skip-jump away in this little hamlet called <strong>&ldquo;Pickles Gap&rdquo;</strong>.  Great name, right?   Even better&ndash; there&rsquo;s a neighborhood burrough in downtown Conway called <strong>&ldquo;Toad Suck&rdquo;</strong>, which has <a href="https://www.toadsuck.org/" target="_blank">it&amp;rsquo;s own festival</a>. See the explanation for the name <a href="https://www.allaboutarkansas.com/toad-suck-ar-meaning/" target="_blank">here</a>. Believe me when I say Arkansas has great names for places&ndash; <a href="https://www.onlyinyourstate.com/arkansas/silly-towns-ar/" target="_blank">here&amp;rsquo;s a few more</a>.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="more-about-the-friendliness---two-experiences">More about the Friendliness&ndash; Two Experiences</h2>
<p>Let me re-emphasize how friendly people are by sharing two more experiences.</p>
<p>Our drove into Arkansas via Texas on Interstate 30, entering Texarkana.  We took our usual habit of stopping at a Welcome Center whenever entering a new state.   As the automatic doors swung open for us going in, we were actually greeted by a human being. <em>(I didn&rsquo;t know it at the time, but Arkansas State Parks hires</em> <a href="https://www.arkansas.com/arkansas-welcome-centers" target="_blank">travel consultants for all their welcome centers</a> ). A nice lady working at the Welcome Center, chimed a &ldquo;Hello, welcome to Arkansas! Glad you&rsquo;re here!&rdquo;.</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;Glad I&rsquo;m here?&quot;</em> Didn&rsquo;t make sense.  I guess she didn&rsquo;t see our California license plate.  Aren&rsquo;t locals resentful when out-of-stater&rsquo;s pull into your area?  It took our entire stay in Arkansas for me to realize that&rsquo;s not how people here think.  They are genuinely welcoming.  They embrace visitors, passer-throughs, relocaters&ndash; anyone who wants to enjoy their state.   The lady took more time explaining all the neat things to do in Arkansas.  I don&rsquo;t remember it all; frankly, I just wanted to use the bathroom.  But too, I was simply caught off guard by her candid hospitality.</p>
<p>The other example occurred at a chiropracter&rsquo;s office.  Long hours in a car, on the road for weeks-on-end, left my back in bad shape.  I was in pain.  I finally reached out to a <a href="https://www.bledsoechiropractic.com/" target="_blank">local chiropracter in Conway</a> to ask if they would see me  a couple times just to get adjusted.  I told them I was from California, visiting the area only a few weeks, and I&rsquo;d pay out-of-pocket, whatever it cost.</p>
<p>Well, they made special accommodation for me.  They fit me quickly into their schedule.  I remember my first time walking into the office&ndash; it was like going to church.   Smiling, welcoming faces greeted me.  Bible scriptures in picture frames adorned the walls.  When the receptionist saw me, I was immediately addressed by name&ndash; like they knew me for years.  &ldquo;Hello, Shawn?! So glad you&rsquo;re here! Let get&rsquo;s your paperwork going right away so you can see our therapist&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Ah, that refrain&ndash; <em>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re so glad you&rsquo;re here!&quot;</em>.  It was echoed several times in my 3 visits to the office.  And it was repeated in other moments, in other places, during our stay in Arkansas.</p>
<p>Again: <strong>Wow</strong>.</p>
<p>BTW&ndash; my three visits helped my back alot.  It made continuing our road trip that much easier.</p>
<h2 id="snowed-in---in-conway">Snowed In - In Conway</h2>
<p>We stayed in Conway &ndash; er, *&ldquo;Pickles Gap&rdquo;*n&ndash; during February 2021.  Besides COVID wreaking havoc in the Mid-West and South, the other notable event was the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/February_13%E2%80%9317,_2021_North_American_winter_storm" target="_blank">unusual and extreme ice/snow storm that hit during the month</a> &ndash; the one that knocked out power in Texas.   We were snowed in our AirBnb for five days.  We couldn&rsquo;t get our non-AWD/4WD SUV out of the driveway, it was iced over <em>(and on an incline)</em>. No snow plows showed up on our street&ndash; just had to wait it out.    Fortunately, we never lost power, heat, or internet service <em>(so I continued teleworking)</em>.</p>
<p><img src="/places/gallery/ar/ar_33.jpg" alt="snowedin"></p>
<h2 id="final-observations">Final Observations</h2>
<p>We got to visit family in the area (when the roads weren&rsquo;t iced over), and that was great.</p>
<p><img src="/places/gallery/ar/ar_3.jpg" alt="snowedin2"></p>
<p>Conway is a very nice city.   Again, COVID (and ice/snow/cold) limited our exploration of the area.  So we had to settle for some milder, shorter outings. But they were fun. Like a stop at a <a href="https://bluesailcoffee.com/" target="_blank">Blue Sail Coffee shop on Front Street</a>.  And across the street, the local <a href="https://www.patticakesbakery.com/" target="_blank">PattiCakes Bakery</a> that had yummy scones.  Or picking up some trinkets and jams from <a href="https://www.bellurbanfarm.com/" target="_blank">Bell Urban Farm</a></p>
<p>And&ndash; what visit to Arkansas would be complete without BBQ?  We took that up for Valentine&rsquo;s day, shying away from the chocolates and sweets, and instead wooing my wife with brisket and sausage from <a href="https://wholehogconway.com/" target="_blank">the Whole Hog Smokehouse</a>.  It&rsquo;s one of the <strong>many</strong> smokehouses in the area.</p>
<p>This was our first extended stay where I did <strong>not</strong> get to do a day hike&ndash; I was all prepped to trek up <a href="https://www.arkansasstateparks.com/parks/pinnacle-mountain-state-park" target="_blank">Pinnacle Mountain</a>, but alas, on the weekend I had planned we were iced in.</p>
