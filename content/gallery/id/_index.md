Photos compiled from **two** visits to the Treasure Valley *(i.e., greater Boise) area of Idaho.  One visit occurred in November 2020, where we stayed in Meridian.  The other was in April 2021 in northside Boise.  The pics are mixed up, hard to say when was when.  On our latter visit, we did get a fun day trip to McCall on a cold, snowy April weekend that made highlighted how diverse climate-wise that Idaho is:  34deg in McCall the same day it was 60deg in Boise.
