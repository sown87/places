Hi, my name is Shawn, and this is a simple travel blog site.  It's meant to capture observations of the places that my wife Shondy and I visited as we traveled by car around the United States during the pandemic years of 2020 and 2021.  However, it also includes some trails and backcountry areas I hiked as side-trips where we had extended stays.

<!---
Though our *around-the-country* journey has concluded, I plan on adding more posts to this site in the future.   We'll have many side-trips around the Mid-West and South USA in the coming months.

This blog site is achieved courtesy of several neat, modern technologies that make running your own static website easy.  So to give credit where credit is due:

- [Hugo Static Site Generator](https://gohugo.io) which is super easy to use.  Having this site simply be creation/edits of Markdown files can't be any more straightforward
- The Hugo theme `I am Sam` courtesy of [Victoria Drake](https://victoria.dev) and *(in her own words)* her lovely team of [contributors](https://github.com/victoriadrake/hugo-theme-sam/graphs/contributors). All the heavy lifting for the *look-and-feel* of this site comes from their work.
- [GitHub](https://github.com) and [GitHub Pages](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/about-github-pages) where this site is hosted and built.

Finally, I purpose this site as a hobby for the enjoyment of friends and family-- and anyone who discovers this site browsing the internet-- without the use of social media.  So there are no ads, endorsements, request for funding, login, or privileged content on any page.  

<!---
With the exception of AWS logs that I use for diagnostics *(primarily IP addresses)*, I don't collect any personal information.
