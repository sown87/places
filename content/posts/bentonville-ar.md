## Northwest Arkansas -- There's a Whole Different Thing Going On
Whatever picture you have in your head about Arkansas-- throw it out.   Especially if your first foray into the state is anywhere along the Interstate 49 corridor that comprises Northwest Arkansas-- a.k.a. NWA for short.  

If you are familiar with retail, you probably know that Bentonville is the headquarters and home office of [Walmart](https://walmart.com), the [Fortune 1](https://fortune.com/company/walmart/fortune500/) company *(note: Fortune 1 -- not Fortune 100)* that employs a 2.6 million people worldwide.   When you add that the nearby area is also home to [Tyson Foods](https://www.tysonfoods.com/) and [JB Hunt Trucking](https://www.jbhunt.com/)-- two Fortune 100 companies-- and a [major university](https://www.uark.edu/), it should be duly recognized that this is NOT a backwood, folk-sy, under-served area.

On the contrary, Bentonville-- and all of [Northwest Arkansas](https://findingnwa.com/) -- is in reality very affluent, urban, modern, chic, artsy.  It's [one of the fastest growing cities in the United States](https://nwacouncil.org/2020/05/21/bentonville-ranks-as-nations-5th-fastest-growing-city/) and is alongside [one of the highest ranked cities for living](https://realestate.usnews.com/places/arkansas/fayetteville) in the United States.  

This is the area that Shondy and I spent the first week of March 2021.  And boy, were we surprised with what we encountered--and how much of it was free.

## But First-- The Car Accident
Uh, yeah-- we got in a little fender bender within 5 minutes of arriving in NWA.  

We had just driven up from Conway, Arkansas, along Interstate 49.  We pull into Fayetteville onto Martin Luther King Blvd, waiting at a stoplight-- then *wham*.  We got rear-ended.  It propelled us into the car in front of us, and they got banged up too.   The front and rear damage wasn't bad enough that we couldn't drive, but we were shaken up.   All parties in the accident were cooperative.  The Fayetteville police officer was nice.   But ugh-- we had to get it fixed.  But with only a few days in the area, we'd have to take car of that later.

## Walmart Philanthropy
Whether you're a die-hard Walmart fan or not, you can't but travel anywhere in NWA and not admire the trickle-down economic benefit of their retail empire.  New buildings are everywhere.  Businesses are thriving.  The cars are nicer.  Homes are ornate, lawns are manicured.  I saw a Tesla-- you don't see that elsewhere in Arkansas.  Lots of stuff is free: the [Crystal Bridges Museum](https://crystalbridges.org/)-- with a world-class art collection that rivals any big city-- costs nothing to visit.  

It's not just Bentonville-- but the whole NWA area.  The [Razorback Greenway](https://www.nwarpc.org/razorback-regional-greenway/) -- a 30mile or so length of off-street bike and walk paths, from Fayetteville to Bella Vista-- benefited from the Walton family generosity too.  Shondy and I walked a stretch of that every day from our downtown AirBnB in Bentonville, meandering outside the boutique shops and hipster eateries the downtown district offered.  We shared that stretch with lots of people-- many out for a nice stroll or mountain bike thrill along one of the several manicured, pre-cut [single-track spurs](https://www.oztrails.com/trail-locations/slaughter-pen/) off the Greenway.   Seemed like everyone here owns a mountain bike. I saw more than one elderly group with their helmets and shiny Trek fat-wheeled MTB (probably from [Phat Tire](https://www.phattirebikeshop.com/) ) on a leisurely ride through the forested paved trails.

In sum... this place is prosperous.  Everyone here seems to be thriving.  Folks look perked up, healthy, content.  The Walton family's success has generously poured into the area, and NWA's 500,000 residents are it's beneficiaries.

## "You Belong Here"
One evening, Shondy and I visited another Walmart-supported attraction, [The Momentary](https://themomentary.org/).  It's completely free art museum, hangout, entertainment venue, and shopping area sorta rolled into one.  Ok, well, the shopping area is [it's own distinct thing](http://www.8stmarket.com/), but still-- they're right next to each other.

We had a hard time imagining all this being free.   In California, you'd be charged $25 just to sit down somewhere on the premise.  But 
here?  No problem!  Feel free to hang out, grab a beer *(note: beer not free)*, and kick-back along one of the glass firepits adorning 
the front of the facility.  The meander into the art exhibit area and enjoy one of several showings they rotate in regularly.

There's this huge neon sign there that says **"You Belong Here"**.   That sorta sums up alot of what we encountered in Arkansas-- friendly people, and a very welcoming spirit (see my Conway blog [here](/places/posts/conway-ar/) ).

I think most people would **easily** consider belonging here-- i.e., living in the area.  We sure did.

## Other Observations
When we were in Fayetteville, I had to put money in a parking meter.  I was floored to find that a quarter-- 25cents-- gave me 1 hour and forty minutes of parking.   In California, 25cents *might* amount to 5minutes, if 25cents were even accepted.

There's a very [sophisticated tea store](https://savoytea.com/) in Rogers where we purchased nearly 30 different varieties of tea.  Ditto for the sophisticated [spice shop](https://www.spiceandtea.com/bentonville) in Bentonville.  This area wouldn't have such distinct shops without discriminating, affluent customers--another testament to the prosperity around us.

We ate catfish at [Flying Fish](https://www.flyingfishinthe.net/location?l=Bentonville) and pork rinds at [Tusk & Trotter](https://www.tuskandtrotter.com/) -- both entrees being common cuisine in Arkansas.

If you enjoy wine or beer like we do, one major heads up:  Arkansas has 'wet' counties and 'dry' counties-- those who do and don't sell alcohol.  And though we enjoyed some wine visiting NWA, taxes on alcohol everywhere typically exceed 10%.
