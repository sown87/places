## Placerville: not just a Place to Pass Through
Our stay in Placerville wasn't unfamiliar.  We've been *through* it several times on the way to South Lake Tahoe, perhaps taking time to stop at one of the [busiest In-N-Out]() restaurants in the entire chain.  Most Sierra Nevada foothill towns like Placerville take on a "pass-through" identity for people heading to higher-elevation recreation sites for skiing, hiking, backpacking, etc. But in recent years, as we had family relocate here, our time in Placerville transformed from waiting at stop-lights along HWY 50 into into short 2-3 day stays.  So we had at least a *bit* more background with what the town has to offer.

Now, with a month-long stay in October 2020, we had time to explore.  And honestly, there's plenty to see, do-- and drink.

## But first:  If you like a good workout when you take a walk...
OK, I have to mention: as someone who likes to walk, I got my chances to use my two feet to gain some distance around Placerville.   And what stood out?  Well, going anywhere means you either go up, or down.

It's not an exaggeration.  If you do encounter level surface anywhere, it's given a street or path name ending in the word 'Flat'.  Like "Smith Flat" or "Missouri Flat".  For anywhere else-- well, be prepared to break a sweat.  Just thought you'd might like to know.

## It's All about the Wine 
Now about that *drink* word mentioned above:  IMHO, Placerville shines brightest when you take your adventure to the vineyards.  There's some really nice wineries in and around Placerville.  And the wine is pretty darn good.  Shondy and I stayed in an AirBnB near the highly-touted Apple Hill area, and that afforded us several winery choices.   

We had two standout visits at [Fenton Herriott](https://www.fentonherriott.com/) and [Lewis Grace](https://gracepatriotwines.com/) Wineries.   Many wineries had to get creative about keeping wine tasting open during the pandemic, and both succeeded in this.  They had great outdoor seating, scenic views, and places for guests to meander around outside. Fenton Herriott made these nifty oak wine barrel slats with five (5) holes bored into them for serving.  Our entire flight was poured into plastic cups that fit nicely into the slat holes, and served all at once, so the hostess didn't need to repeatedly fill each tasting *(they actually **gave** us a couple slats! That was a nice gesture...)*.  Lewis Grace did something similar-- each wine in the flight in separate glask flasks that *you* poured into your own glass.   The Fenton Herriot Gewurztraminer and the Lewis Grace Pinot Noir wines really stood out.   With the October weather being beautiful on the days we visited these wineries, we were in no rush to leave.  We took our time enjoying the moment.

## Other Observations
Wherever I went, I noticed lots of *young* people around Placerville-- meaning, those in their 20's and early 30's.  That surprised me.  Placerville isn't really a college town-- the closest being the Sacramento area colleges.  But it seems to be attracting a younger crowd.

Maybe the younger crowd was a *time-of-year* thing: Apple Hill in October is beautiful weather-wise, and yet **VERY** crowded.  Lots of young families appear. There's harvest-type celebrations and hay-bale mazes that go on up there.   Besides wines, you can also pick up lots of produce and fruits and apple-pie type of foods.   We made more than one visit to Boa Vista during our stay.

The downtown area seems a nice blend of keeping the historic "Old Hang-Town" feel while mixing up with some more affluent boutique-type shopping.  

Like nearly all the places we planned on visiting, we steered clear of indoor dining due to COVID.  Which meant the restaurants we saw walking in downtown Placerville weren't part of our experience.  But even then they **were** quite busy and popular.

And of course-- Placerville is close to Tahoe.   We had to take at least one visit there during October, which resulted in a terrific time catching rays at Nevada Beach State Park, and eating a darn good burrito from Burrito Brothers.
