## Try, Try Again
When we first visited here last fall (see previous post [here](/posts/meridian-id/) ), we didn't feel like we got a good-enough look around the area.  Winter was setting in alongside COVID, and it made getting out a bit tough.

So we opted for a second visit.  This time, we secured an AirBnB apartment in the highly desirable and eclectic [north-end Boise neighborhood](https://www.northendboise.org/). Right next door, in fact to the [Boise Co-op](https://www.boise.coop/), which we frequented last fall.  Unlike the Meridian store, this location even has it's [own wine shop](https://www.boise.coop/uncorked-wine-bar).

The Co-op was about to take even more of our money this visit ;-).


## Hooray for Spring!!
We arrived in Boise the first week of April 2021 for a month-long stay.   The city was blooming-- cherry blossom petals peeking out, leaves turning green, people wearing T-shirts and shorts.  Wow, so different from November.   We were excited!  We'd just spent months battling cold, ice, and snow in several other states.  We were **SO** ready for spring!!

And we did get it-- though, with some very cold days intermingled here and there.  But our north-end neighborhood was so walkable.  We walked everywhere.  [Hyde Park](https://northend.org/historic-hyde-park/), with all it's chic stores and eateries, was close by.  So too was [CamelBack Park](https://www.cityofboise.org/departments/parks-and-recreation/parks/camels-back-park/) and the renowned [River-to-Ridges trail system](https://www.ridgetorivers.org/).  We took several evenings strolling the neighborhood.  We spent one evening picnicing in CamelBack Reserve, alongside the creek, while locals hiked or biked along the trails nearby.  I walked up Camel Back Hill every morning (great workout for my thighs). 

But head south, and we were just blocks from downtown Boise and all it offered.  We casually windowed shopped the stores and art galleries there, ate out a couple times, and simply enjoyed the city.

It had been a **long** time since we felt like getting outside each evening.  We surely made up for it here, and the weather was mostly cooperative.

## Not your Typical Big City
One really fascinating thing I noticed while living in Boise: **it seemed awfully quiet**.  I mean, for being the state capitol and largest city in Idaho, I found it shockingly calm compared to other big cities I've been to.  You wouldn't know there's 250,000 residents around you.  And I never felt threatened walking anywhere in Boise.   People seemed undisturbed, carrying on with their lives, and enjoying the moment.   There was a certain un-hurriedness and peacefulness about it.

I dunno, maybe it's just me.  Maybe it was the time of year.  But I have one measurement to justify this feeling: a real absence of sirens.   I can only remember hearing a police or fire or ambulance siren **one time** in an entire month of being in Boise.  Once.  And mind you- we're living in *downtown* Boise, in an apartment on a busy thoroughfare.   In Santa Cruz, my hometown back in California, I would hear sirens go off multiple times daily.


## Et tu, McCall?  Winter's Last Holdout
One Saturday, we decided to journey further afield-- to [McCall Idaho](https://visitmccall.org/), a couple hours drive north of Boise.  I had to see the mountain-and-forest side of things that I so eagerly expected after reading outdoor magazines for years.

First off-- the road trip up Idaho HWY 55 isn't smooth.  There's tumbling rocks and roadwork to navigate through along very narrow stretches of pavement.  But it's beautiful, winding along the Payette River and through cute towns like Smith's Ferry, Cascade, Horseshoe Bend.  Very enjoyable-- just gotta take your time.  We arrived in McCall in one piece, and sure enough, I got my mountains and forests.

But we also got something unexpected-- **ice and snow**.

Whereas it was around 60degF when we left Boise, up there in McCall it was like 34degF.  Man, what a difference.  If you like snow lingering in your yard for 9 months a year, then you'll love McCall.  Actually, it seemed like a neat mountain town and resort get-away that reminded me alot of South Lake Tahoe.   You got skiing nearby for 3 seasons, and a gorgeous lakefront for summer splashing.

Shondy and I, fully bundled up, spent the nice day there.  The downtown area is easily walked.  We took in lunch along the lakefront, caught a coffee at the [ShoreLodge Resort](https://shorelodge.com/), and poked around a few shops like [this cute kitchen store](https://www.bellakitchen.com/). After about four hours, we got our full visit in.

It was short but pleasnt.  Winter definitely holds on for dear life in McCall, until summer finally conquers it.  We headed back to Boise early enough to avoid remaining caught anymore in Winter's grasp.  We'd had plenty of that the past several months.


## Other Observations
I was pleasantly surprised to find surfers in Boise.   No, it wasn't like being back home in Santa Cruz, California with those Pacific swells on the coastline.  Instead, it was a cleverly designed spillway on the Boise River situated between North Boise and Garden City.  

Gotta love anytime any store has tax free days-- especially [if it involves wine](https://www.boise.coop/events/tax-day-wine-sale).

Ward Hooper makes [some awesome art](https://www.wardhooper.com/).  We bought more that one print from his store, and a couple of his prints were in our AirBnB.

With spring here, Shondy and I enjoyed outside dining a bit more this visit-- with an exquisite Basque meal at [this downtown restaurant](https://www.thebasquemarket.com/), a burger and shake at [this historic burger joint](https://fancifreez.com/), and a luxuriously ice cream sundae at this popular [candy shop and soda fountain](https://www.goodyssodafountain.com/) in the Hyde Park area.  All of this just a few minutes walk from our AirBnB in the north-end Boise neighborhood.
