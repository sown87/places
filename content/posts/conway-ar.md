## Friendly People, Fabulous Names
OK, so right off the top, let me jump into a couple observations about Arkansas:
1. **Friendly People**.  Call it Southern courtesy, or simply good manners-- whatever you want-- but compared to Western states, it was very noticeable how friendly people are in Arkansas.   And it goes beyond the *"yes ma'am"* or *"yes sir"* etiquette.  Folks in Arkansas look you in the eye.  If you're walking down a road and a car passes bye, it's expected that you wave at the driver, in a sorta *"Howdy, have a good day!"* kinda way. And they wave back.  We loved it.  At the AirBnb we stayed in, a solar panel salesman came to our door one day.  Politely, we had to beg off, letting him know it's a rental, and wouldn't buy anything.  His response? *"Thank ya'll anyway.  Ya'll have a blessed day!".  Like he was so glad to have stopped by.  Wow.
2. **Fabulous Names** - and I mean, names for **places**.   We actually didn't stay *in* Conway, but just a hop-skip-jump away in this little hamlet called **"Pickles Gap"**.  Great name, right?   Even better-- there's a neighborhood burrough in downtown Conway called **"Toad Suck"**, which has [it's own festival](https://www.toadsuck.org/). See the explanation for the name [here](https://www.allaboutarkansas.com/toad-suck-ar-meaning/). Believe me when I say Arkansas has great names for places-- [here's a few more](https://www.onlyinyourstate.com/arkansas/silly-towns-ar/).

## More about the Friendliness-- Two Experiences
Let me re-emphasize how friendly people are by sharing two more experiences.

Our drove into Arkansas via Texas on Interstate 30, entering Texarkana.  We took our usual habit of stopping at a Welcome Center whenever entering a new state.   As the automatic doors swung open for us going in, we were actually greeted by a human being. *(I didn't know it at the time, but Arkansas State Parks hires* [travel consultants for all their welcome centers](https://www.arkansas.com/arkansas-welcome-centers) ). A nice lady working at the Welcome Center, chimed a "Hello, welcome to Arkansas! Glad you're here!".  

*"Glad I'm here?"* Didn't make sense.  I guess she didn't see our California license plate.  Aren't locals resentful when out-of-stater's pull into your area?  It took our entire stay in Arkansas for me to realize that's not how people here think.  They are genuinely welcoming.  They embrace visitors, passer-throughs, relocaters-- anyone who wants to enjoy their state.   The lady took more time explaining all the neat things to do in Arkansas.  I don't remember it all; frankly, I just wanted to use the bathroom.  But too, I was simply caught off guard by her candid hospitality.

The other example occurred at a chiropracter's office.  Long hours in a car, on the road for weeks-on-end, left my back in bad shape.  I was in pain.  I finally reached out to a [local chiropracter in Conway](https://www.bledsoechiropractic.com/) to ask if they would see me  a couple times just to get adjusted.  I told them I was from California, visiting the area only a few weeks, and I'd pay out-of-pocket, whatever it cost.   

Well, they made special accommodation for me.  They fit me quickly into their schedule.  I remember my first time walking into the office-- it was like going to church.   Smiling, welcoming faces greeted me.  Bible scriptures in picture frames adorned the walls.  When the receptionist saw me, I was immediately addressed by name-- like they knew me for years.  "Hello, Shawn?! So glad you're here! Let get's your paperwork going right away so you can see our therapist".  

Ah, that refrain-- *"We're so glad you're here!"*.  It was echoed several times in my 3 visits to the office.  And it was repeated in other moments, in other places, during our stay in Arkansas. 

Again: **Wow**.

BTW-- my three visits helped my back alot.  It made continuing our road trip that much easier.


## Snowed In - In Conway
We stayed in Conway -- er, *"Pickles Gap"*n-- during February 2021.  Besides COVID wreaking havoc in the Mid-West and South, the other notable event was the [unusual and extreme ice/snow storm that hit during the month](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/February_13%E2%80%9317,_2021_North_American_winter_storm) -- the one that knocked out power in Texas.   We were snowed in our AirBnb for five days.  We couldn't get our non-AWD/4WD SUV out of the driveway, it was iced over *(and on an incline)*. No snow plows showed up on our street-- just had to wait it out.    Fortunately, we never lost power, heat, or internet service *(so I continued teleworking)*.

## Final Observations
We got to visit family in the area (when the roads weren't iced over), and that was great.

Conway is a very nice city.   Again, COVID (and ice/snow/cold) limited our exploration of the area.  So we had to settle for some milder, shorter outings. But they were fun. Like a stop at a [Blue Sail Coffee shop on Front Street](https://bluesailcoffee.com/).  And across the street, the local [PattiCakes Bakery](https://www.patticakesbakery.com/) that had yummy scones.  Or picking up some trinkets and jams from [Bell Urban Farm](https://www.bellurbanfarm.com/)

And-- what visit to Arkansas would be complete without BBQ?  We took that up for Valentine's day, shying away from the chocolates and sweets, and instead wooing my wife with brisket and sausage from [the Whole Hog Smokehouse](https://wholehogconway.com/).  It's one of the **many** smokehouses in the area.

This was our first extended stay where I did **not** get to do a day hike-- I was all prepped to trek up [Pinnacle Mountain](https://www.arkansasstateparks.com/parks/pinnacle-mountain-state-park), but alas, on the weekend I had planned we were iced in.
