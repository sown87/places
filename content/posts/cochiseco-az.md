## Southern Arizona - Desert for Non-Desert People
I highly recommend visiting Arizona.  It's uniquely beautiful.  You can't stand next to a Saguaro or Cholla cactus and not be impressed with how life persists in an extemely hot, dry environment.  Desert vistas with their orange, gold, and yellow hues coloring the dawn (or dusk) are brilliant.  You don't get that from other landscapes.   Honestly, if all I did in Arizona was admire the panaroma each day, it would be a worthwhile visit.

Of course, you usually have to put up with high temperatures and dry heat.  That's not to everyone's taste.  Certainly not mine. So winter tourists are common -- you'll find many Mid-West folks who, for 3-4 months, trade the frigid northern temperatures for the 60deg days afforded them in Arizona.  

And that's pretty much what my wife Shondy and I did for Christmas 2020 and New Years-January 2021.

But we didn't take in the holidays in the more well known areas such as Phoenix, Tuscon, Flagstaff, Prescott, Sedona -- and not at the Grand Canyon-- but in Cochise County, which is in the southeast corner bordering Mexico and New Mexico.

And it's here where you'll find a Sonoran desert experience with lower temps, four seasons, and a variety of outdoor landscapes, history and culture.  In other words-- a place where even people who don't like desert living can enjoy.

## Mexico Snow
For example, it **snows during the winter here**. 

Yes, I did say **snow**.  Right on the Arizona/Mexico border. 

And if you don't like snow... just wait a few hours.  It rarely sticks through the afternoon.  The humidity is so low-- even in winter-- that the atmosphere siphons off ground moisture quickly. 

We experienced several snowy days during our stay.

## History and Hippies
So here's a quick hit of what we encountered in Cochise County.   Had it not been that alot of this was closed due to COVID, I'd give more detail.  But I've been to these places before, so I share thoughts based on past experience:

- **Tombstone** ,er, the site of the [OK Corral shootout](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gunfight_at_the_O.K._Corral).  You know, Doc Holliday and Wyatt Earp and their shootout with the Clantons and McLaurys?  Yep, it happened here.  It's a tourist haven for old-west nostalgia now, with re-enactments and cowboy-stuff.  But a worthwhile visit (once COVID passes).
- **Karchner Caverns** An Arizona State Park, [Karchner Caverns](https://azstateparks.com/kartchner/) is high on the awesome list.  Not as famous-- yet-- as Carlsbad Caverns, but hey, give it time.  I remember I tour I took there one winter-- it was like 45deg outside, and you walk in the caverns-- 68deg.  No joke. The other amazing things:  it's really wet inside, and it's **HUGE**.  The caverns were... well, cavernous.  There were ponds, and water was dripping everywhere.  Yes, there is water in Arizona if you know where to find it.  Karchner Caverns only recently became an Arizona State Park after being [kept a secret for several years after discovery](https://azstateparks.com/kartchner/explore/park-history).
- **Bisbee** the town, is actually the [county seat of Cochise County](https://www.bisbeeaz.gov/).  And-- well, it's like a California hippie town in the middle of the desert.   That, along with a huge no-longer-in-operation copper pit, make is really distinct, quirky.   Seems like anyone who was liberal-leaning, and wanted a desert enclave from the otherwise conversative rest of Arizona, made Bisbee their home.  AFAICT, it's a haven for artists and writers and political detractors.   Whether you're one of them or not,  you'll still be surprised with how there's Victorian homes built up the sides of a narrow rock canyon.  Several homes are accessible only by climbing a long set of stairs up canyon walls.

## Coronado National Monument
So what does one do when lots of stuff is shut down for COVID?  Pick nature-- your God-provided outside entertainment center.  And Cochise County has some nice offerings, perhaps no finer than [Coronado National Monument](https://www.nps.gov/coro/index.htm).  I spent two weekends hiking there, and it was fabulous.  Views for dozens of miles far off into Mexico.  Highly recommended!

## Other Observations
Let it be known that Chicago-style Hot Dogs can be had [right near the Mexican border](https://jimmysbisbee.com/#!/).  Jimmy's makes some tasty hot dogs.
