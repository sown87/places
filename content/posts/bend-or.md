## If I had come here long before, I would have moved here...
Our stay in Bend was brief-- less than a week.  Which is unfortunate.  I should have stayed a month.

Or maybe the rest of my life.

Let me explain.  I've spent the majority of my life living in Santa Cruz, California, which IMHO is unmatched by most locale's on this planet.  I've been spoiled.  Santa Cruz has great weather, sits alongside an unparalled scenic stretch of the Pacific Ocean, has Redwood trees, mountains, valleys, agriculture, wineries, surfing, mountain biking, arts, music, a University of California, varied entertainment, ... geesh, I could go on.  People, when they come to Santa Cruz, don't want to leave *(of course, unless you're a millionaire, the high cost of living means you have to)*.   In my years there, I took advantage of enjoying many things Santa Cruz has to offer.   And I'm grateful for it.  So whenever I considered leaving Santa Cruz, I concluded I should keep my expectations low, figuring I wouldn't find any place as nice as Santa Cruz.

Then I came to Bend.

## Living Outdoors-- Ain't nothing better
If you swap 

- the Pacific Ocean for the Deschutes River (+ some nearby lakes)
- Redwood Trees for Douglas Fir
- Surfing for Skiing/Snowboarding
- Univ of California campus for Oregon State campus
- Local Winegrowing for Craft Beer

Then Santa Cruz, California is transformed into Bend, Oregon.  I swear, my few days in Bend felt so much like home.  I think that had to do alot with my enjoyment of being outdoors-- plus the fact that the weather was perfect in Bend during our stay.

Since I wasn't teleworking, both Shondy and I got outside alot.  I took two day-long hikes up Mt Bachelor and along the Deschutes River Trail.  We picniced along some beautiful trails with groceries from [Market of Choice](https://www.marketofchoice.com/locations-bend/).  Though COVID was wreaking havoc at the time, we chanced outdoor dining at [Worthy Brewery](https://worthy.beer/) where I got an elk/bison burger and a fun beer sampler.   But even with the weather being beautiful, November temperatures kept it nippy during the day, so to be outside we ventured to [one of the many outdoor stores in Bend](https://www.gearfix.com/) looking for some cool-weather apparel.

Bend is great for the outdoors type.  Frankly, any town that [has a FjallRaven store in it's downtown area](https://stores.fjallraven.com/or/bend/) has to be awesome.

## What Bend-ites really care about
Here's something that struck my funny-bone.

Just by chance, we were in Bend during November 2020, on the week of the US Presidential Election pitting Trump vs Biden.   With all the political riots going on nearby in Portland, I imagined Bend-ites being sorta keyed-up as well about the election.  So as I carried on my vacation-ing ways around Bend, I kept my eyes and ears open to what local's were saying.  I mean, everyone in the country was talking about the election, right?

To my surprise-- nay, shock-- I heard nothing about the election.   What's more, I saw far less political signage in front of homes and businesses than I was used to back in California.   But I did pick up on something else that carried far more weight than any election, or even any pandemic.   I'm not joking when I share what was most on Bend-ites minds:

**"WHEN WILL THE SNOW GET HERE SO WE CAN START SKIING?"**

There you go, outdoor-lovers!  Bend-ites have their priorities...

## Final Observations.

I could live in Bend.  And love it.  No problem.   I'm not sure if the current Bend natives would want me, though.  Like Santa Cruz, the cost of living in Bend is high-- and growing higher with the flock of expatriat Californian's fleeing the state for one reason or another.  But if our Lord on High every purposed me to live there, I'd not hesitate one bit.

The Cascades are darn pretty.  So glad I got to spend time there.

Yes, the beer in Bend is good.  Really good.  Even the [simple pub beer from 10 Barrels Brewery](https://10barrel.com/beer/pub-beer/) is off-the charts tasty.

As for the snow-- well, it arrived on the day we left.   A visit to the slopes will have to wait.

Like burgers?  This elk/bison one from Worthy Brewery was off the charts-- I didn't have to eat for 2 days.
