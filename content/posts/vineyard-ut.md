## The Newly Minted City
We arrived in [Vineyard, Utah](https://vineyardutah.org/) at the start of December 2020.  We came here to visit family living in the Salt Lake City area.  Too, a few friends we know spoke highly of SLC, and how it's becoming a popular destination for people looking for tech jobs.  So we figured a two-week stay outta cover our family visit-- and our curiosity to see why it's so attractive.

I'm not sure where the name "Vineyard" came from.   There weren't any vines that I could see, and Utah isn't exactly known as a grape-growing region.  Nevertheless, I won't chasten their founding fathers-- perhaps they just wanted to have a 'bespoke' name to draw people there.

Frankly, that hasn't been hard.  Vineyard sits in the [Salt Lake City Metropolitan Area](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salt_Lake_City_metropolitan_area), adjacent to Orem and Provo.  And with so many people coming to SLT looking for housing, Vineyard as acquired the distinction as the [fastest growing city in the whole of Utah](https://www.sltrib.com/news/politics/2020/05/21/fastest-growing-city/).  It became an incorporated city just in 2016, and the conversion of a former steel production site into thousands of new *(and affordable)* housing units has spurred many dwelling-seekers to make Vineyard home.   

Turns out, we stayed in an AirBnB apartment in one of those new housing developments.  While the apartment complex wasn't anything special, the unit itself was well stocked and nicely decorated-- perhaps the nicest AirBnB we've been in.

## Rock, Sky and Ice
The immediate thing that stood out to me-- actually, to anyone-- in the SLT metropolitan area are **the MOUNTAINS**.   I mean, the whole [Wasatch mountain range](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wasatch_Range) is **RIGHT THERE** in your face, running north-south along the entire metropolitan corridor.   It fascinated me to see urban and suburban streets, homes, businesses that ran right up to the base of the mountain, then **BAM** -- sheer rock juts straight up a couple thousand feet.   You have to crane your neck up to see the top, it's so close.

That alone-- the easy, direct access to hiking, skiing and outdoors-- explains the SLT area popularity, IMHO.  I get it.  Sure, you gotta have jobs, and housing, and entertainment-- but many places have those.   SLT has that-- but it's also got this towering, dominating, authoritative, natural rock wonder of God sitting in your urban backyard everyday that other places can only envy.   From our apartment in Vineyard, I loved looking out toward the range, taking in the morning sun as it cast it's yellow-orange light over mountain peaks...

...that is, when it wasn't overcast and snowing.

Um, it snowed a fair bit.  And ice formed everywhere. Now, I love the snow, but our two weeks in an apartment-- mind you, one that was on the third floor, with no elevator and an outside stairwell that was iced-over-- took effort to navigate each day.  I slipped more than once.   And we experienced the joy of scraping our windshield and warming up our car for 15minutes whenever going out.  And since we didn't have an AWD or 4WD vehicle, a couple times the roads were too icy for our California-bred driving habits to overcome.  But Shondy and I laughed about it-- just part of the experience!!

## Slip-Sliding with the BYU kids
I love hiking.  One Sunday we caught a break in the weather, and I convinced Shondy we should stretch our legs a bit.  Heck with the snow... let's try to find a popular trail that wouldn't be too slippery.   So we set out for the [Rock Canyon Trail](https://www.provo.org/Home/Components/FacilityDirectory/FacilityDirectory/52/200) that runs east out of Provo, UT.  

It turned out to be a really fun time.  The trail narrows into a gorge that carry's on for miles, with rock face of the canyon hovering over us.  With snow around and tree's peeking through the snow cover, it was beautiful

But again-- it **WAS COLD**. And despite my best planning, the trail was fairly icy. Shondy and I were garbed in four layers, with our grippiest, Vibram-outsoled shoes. Still we had to hold onto each other alot to keep from falling.  Don't think we even went two miles before turning around.

Yet I couldn't believe watching the other people who wandered the trail with us-- namely, a whole bunch of BYU students.  I got the impression that taking a brisk walk in nature was a common BYU thing on a Sunday afternoon.  These kids seemed impervious to the temperature outside and the ice beneath their feet.   Shondy noticed more than one girl wearing VAN'S sneakers. Some boys had on Oxford dress shoes.  Yet they just skipped right past us like it was nothing.  And they were wearing their Sunday church clothes-- light sweater for girls or button up shirt for boys.   

How could they not be cold?  Personally, I chalked it up to the fact that these kids, in packs of several boys and girls together, were in full flirt mode.  They musta been a little steamed up on the inside.  ;-)


## Other Observations
After that Rock Canyon experience, I broke down and bought some microspikes three days later.  I was done with slipping on ice.

We had a fabulous time seeing family, and wished that COVID would have made it easier to get out to the restaurants.  Hopefully another time.

It was December, and fresh fruit wasn't easy to come by.  But Shondy found [this cool little apple orchard store](https://www.crandallsfruitfarm.com/) where she bought some really tasty apples.

One day we took a walk along Utah Lake, near our Vineyard apartment, when the sun came out.  Captured a great pic of what looks like two guys standing out on the lake.  And indeed they were-- the lakeside was frozen.
