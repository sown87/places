## Only One Thing to Say:  GO!
I could use all sorts of superlatives, and heap all sorts of praise, on how great Zion National Park is.  And it would all be true.

But I'd be articulating poorly what so many other writers, artists, outdoor enthusiasts, etc. have, in the past, stated better.  Instead, I'll let the photos speak for themselves.

I only leave the readers of this blog post with one command:  Go.   

Go to Zion, and take in the amazement.  Put it on your bucket list.  Save your $$.  It will be worth it.

## Other Observations
I *tried* to make it all the way to Angel's Landing, but took a pass on that *hold-the-chain-at-the-edge-of-the-1500'-cliff* last 100 yards.   Yeah, it terrified me.  But so did all the 100's of tourists walking in sneakers on ice, trying it at the same time.  It was the weekend before Christmas 2020, and it was crowded.   All I could think about was slipping, or catching COVID from sharing the chain with the hundreds of people.

But I had all day, so I added the Emerald Pools trails to my adventure afterwards.   Fabulous time!
