## From Arid to Damp to College Kids
By May 2021, when we arrived in Eugene, most of our time had been visting the more 'arid' parts of the country like Idaho, Utah, Arizona, Texas, Colorado.   Cresting the Cascades coming over from Bend, that changed quickly.   Dry high desert vegetation gave way to moist douglas fir.  In fact, at the first glimpse of a grove of mossy firs, Shondy and I pulled off the highway, and just walked around and smelled.  I love that wet bark fragrance-- reminds me of taking a fresh Christmas tree home.  

The city of Eugene is one pretty tree'd city.   It's green everywhere.  I loved that.  But in this city, going outside to meet nature is balanced by having to hold back nature coming inside to meet **you**.   With all the precipitation it gets, people need to clear weeds and cut lawns often.  Living there seems to a constant battle beating back vegetation from overtaking everything.   And the critters that live there love all the green.  One day on a walk from our AirBnB, I came across some wild turkeys chillin' in a neighbors yard.  These guys were the fattest turkeys I've seen in any urban area.  Ditto for the birds and squirrels milling around.   It's a rich, lush land.

The other distinguishing factor for Eugene:  college students.  Lots of them.   Home to the [University of Oregon](https://www.uoregon.edu/), the city of Eugene basically builds it's identity and culture and economy around the school.  The entertainment, dining, shops, and events all seem tailored for student living.   Our neighbor (in his 50's) described a recent shindig of "Ducks vs Ducks" sports event on campus, which was attended by lots of frolicking kids.

Now, was that event coincidental with the [COVID infections that ticked up that first week we were there](https://www.registerguard.com/story/news/2021/05/04/lane-county-high-risk-friday-covid-19-gov-brown-oregon-extreme-risk-restaurants/4948937001/)?  Can't say.  But all indoor dining was closed for awhile.  A good reminder to always keep my mask handy in my back pocket.


## The Journey taking it's Toll - Time to wrap up.
After being on the road 9 months, Shondy and I were tired.  Packing and unpacking at each destination had taken it's toll.  Our AirBnB was situated in a quiet neighborhood, and we had this little private back courtyard that caught the afternoon sunlight each day.  Adjacent was a garden and vines putting off a nice spring fragrance.   It was a perfect place just to relax.  And with the COVID infections on the rise around us, that's just what we did.   

Most afternoons, after I finished teleworking for the day, we just sat in the patio, had dinner, and talked about what we should do next.

It was time to wrap up our journey.  But we would still take a handful of days to have fun around Eugene.

## Spencer Butte and Mt Pisgah
I love hiking, and trails in Eugene begin pretty much outside your front door.   One very popular spot-- [Spencer Butte](https://www.eugene-or.gov/Facilities/Facility/Details/-158)-- literally was a 4-mile hike to the top from our AirBnB doorstep.   I took advantage of that more than once.   Views from the top of the Butte are fabulous.  Also nearby, we also had the flat but nicely manicured [Amazon trail](https://www.eugenecascadescoast.org/listing/north-amazon-running-trail/2292/) that I took several mornings, sharing the tender bark-underfoot path with lots of morning joggers.

Too, [Mt Pisgah and its nifty arboretum](https://mountpisgaharboretum.org/) was only a 10min drive away. Lots of neat trails, and a pond with this cool lily-pad where toads basked in the sun.  Gosh, what a nice place to hike.   Shondy and I made a day of it one weekend with a picnic at the top.

## Quick trip to the Pacific
We hadn't seen the Pacific Ocean since last September.  We took one Saturday to meander around [Florence, Oregon](https://traveloregon.com/places-to-go/cities/florence/), about an hours drive from Eugene on the coast.  The drive itself was beautiful, and a shoreline picnic capped that off nicely!  We got a kick scampering down sand dunes on the bluffs along near the levee.

## Other Observations
During our month-long stay, we began a few mornings patronizing this [excellent bakery](https://www.hideawaybakery.com/).  I'm a sucker for a good pastry-- plus, their Pugliese loaf was awesome.  Nice selection of gluten free items too!

It was spring, and that lovely green comes with a downside: allergies.  They hit both of us hard.  And we learned that in Oregon, allergy medicine like Sudafed is *not* over-the counter, but prescribed.  What?!?  For a state that sells recreational marijuana, why would they make Sudafed prescribed?  I couldn't figure that out.  Later, learned that Oregon lawmakers where in the midst of [changing that](https://katu.com/news/local/oregon-house-votes-to-allow-over-counter-sale-of-cold-meds-with-pseudoephedrine).  

Our AirBnB had a daily visitor -- a cat that constantly begged to be fed.  Prior guests must have pampered it with food-- that cat was at our door the moment we drove up.  Well, it was cute --- and annoying at the same time.  But that feline pulled at our heartstrings, so how could we not drop a little something for it to eat?  We ensured the guests that stayed there after us had the same problem ;-).
