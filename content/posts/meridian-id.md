## Wait.. this is Idaho?!?
Until we crossed the Snake River driving from Oregon along Interstate 84, I had never been to Idaho.  It was the second week of November, 2020, and the weather was borderline snow with ice laden clouds overhead, ready to burst.  

That snow part-- yep, I expected that.  Along with snow, the picture I had in my head of Idaho was a place of tall mountains, pine forests, rivers running free, clean air, no crowds, bears walking across the road from time-to-time.  You know, like what you would find featured in outdoor magazines.  Come to think of it, my impressions of Idaho all came from reading outdoor stuff.

But the snow part was the only thing that matched my brain-picture.   I didn't see mountains or forests.  Instead, it was farms and post-harvest onion fields.  And mostly flat highway to boot.  "OK", I thought, "let's drive on a bit further".

And as we neared Meridian, the fields gave way to office buildings and suburban stores-- and lots of new home construction.   Idaho is becoming a MAJOR landing spot for expatriat Californian's fleeing the state, and geesh, no kidding!  The nearby cities of Caldwell and Nampa have alot of housing going up... it was obvious from the highway.   As we came closer to Meridian, I saw a backdrop of Boise Hills with a bit of snow on them, but our surburban environment nearby kept growing.   

## Getting Comfortable in Meridian
Now, I'm not complaining.  We stayed in Meridian, Idaho for the remainder of November *(and celebrated Thanksgiving there)*. We very much enjoyed it.  The AirBnB we rented was indeed in a suburban area, in a nice neighborhood with lawns, a little walking path nearby, mature trees that were dropping leavees, and friendly neighbors.   I spent one afternoon raking leaves, just to look like one of the neighborhood gang.   Our AirBnB was comfortable, and our AirBnB host super nice.  

It just wasn't the Idaho I imagined.  It seem more like Morgan Hill or Pleasanton or some other Bay Area suburb.

But in hindsite, it was a blessing.  Because it kept us warm-- which turned out to be REALLY necessary...

## Baby, It's Cold Outside!
The snow came shortly after our arrival, the next morning.  And yeah-- it was cold.  Idaho is known for getting cold, and though this was only the 20 degF range-- certainly not extreme cold by Idaho standards-- my Californian-bred internal core-temp wasn't having any of it.  Too cold for my routine of walking outside 1 hour each morning.  To be honest, though, this was due to something both my wife and had to admit-- we didn't have any **real** cold-weather apparel.

First line of business- get warm clothes.  Fortunately, the [online outdoor retailer I've loved and shopped at for years](https://www.sierra.com/) has a physical store in Meridian, 2 miles from our AirBnB.  Even better:  it's right next to a [Winco](https://www.wincofoods.com/).  So donned our masks, and headed out to the malls.  We got our 0deg jackets and grocery shopping done in one fell swoop.

And that partly describes Meridian:  It's Idaho, but being a suburb in the [Boise Metropolitan Statistical area](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boise_metropolitan_area), every modern amenity you need for comfortable living is right there.  So I say, to those sub-freezing temperatures that we faced all November: **"Take that, cold"!**

## An Unexpected Adventure in Wine Tasting - Remote Idaho-Style
One Saturday morning, we decided to explore the town of Eagle, just north of Meridian.  We heard about a good [gluten-free bakery there](https://www.perksoflife.com/), and this [other cleverly-named one](https://onehautecookie.net/).  It wasn't snowing at the time, so decided to give 'em a try.  

After our pastry/cookie fix, we opted to drive more.   We saw this road head north from Eagle, and decided, *"Hey, let's just see how far this takes us!"*.  I was curious about how long it would take to hit tree-line, as most of Treasure Valley was pretty grey/brown from where we'd seen.  So we drove north.  And up.

But the road turned from paved to gravel to wet icy dirt and **no** buildings within about 3 miles.  Oh well, guess we have to turn around-- don't want to get stuck if snow started. Then, we noticed a sign nearby:  *"3 Horse Ranch Winery - Just Ahead"*.  

Cool!! Gluten-free pastries, and now wine!  What a stroke of blessing!  Of course, we had to push on to the winery.  We figured it couldn't be far-- after all, we're on an icy dirt road.

Well, 7 miles and 45min later, through totally barren hills and another county, going like 15mph or slower, we arrived at [3 Horse Ranch](https://www.3horseranchvineyards.com/).  Seriously, this place is really the proverbial *"middle of nowhere"*.  But they were open for tasting, with outdoor seating too.  So we settled in *(chilly Idaho fashion, 4 layers + our winter coats)"* at a table on the lawn, and enjoyed some high-altitude Idaho Malbec wine with Idaho gouda cheese and Elk salami.  I ended up chatting with the proprietor and wine-maker, who was from Napa, and talked about growing grapes in high, cold climates.  It was alot of unexpected fun!

## Other Observations.

We fell in love with the [Boise Co-op](https://www.boise.coop/), and shopped there often, as it was the one place we found fresh*-enough* green vegetables.

I barbecued cornish game hens and potatoes on the grill for Thanksgiving.  Shondy decorated our AirBnB.  It was festive, but only the two of us.  We missed being with our kids.

Yes, we ventured into the city of Boise a handful of times, and I managed a couple of long day hikes in the Boise foothills during our stay.  We need to come back to check out more of Boise, in a different season of year.  And post-COVID, 'cause alot of stuff was closed.

The whole Treasure Valley area was decked out for Christmas.  With the chilly, snowy weather, it actually *felt* like a White Christmas, something I really had no frame-of-reference for after living in Santa Cruz, California most of my life.  So I loved that.  Shondy and I took one evening and walked around the Christmas Light display at the [Idaho Botantical Garden](https://idahobotanicalgarden.org/).  To make it through that without frostbitten fingers, we each had our own pack of handwarmer's purchased earlier in the month from Sierra.  Those came in hand-y. ;-)
