      <description>For all our shared photos while in Colorado, see our Photo Gallery at /places/gallery/co &amp;ldquo;Oh Lord, When will Winter be Over?&amp;rdquo; We arrived in Arvada, Colorado, a suburb of Denver, the second week of March 2021 for a month-long stay. I was excited. We were visiting family in the area, and I was told the weather was looking nice. Spring was coming. Hooray! Since November, we&amp;rsquo;d been bearing through cold and snow and ice traveling in Oregon, Idaho, Utah, Arizona (yes, Arizona had snow, see my blog post here ), Texas, and Arkansas.</description>
