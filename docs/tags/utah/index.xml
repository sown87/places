      <description>For all our shared photos while in Utah, see our Photo Gallery at /places/gallery/ut Only One Thing to Say: GO! I could use all sorts of superlatives, and heap all sorts of praise, on how great Zion National Park is. And it would all be true.
But I&amp;rsquo;d be articulating poorly what so many other writers, artists, outdoor enthusiasts, etc. have, in the past, stated better. Instead, I&amp;rsquo;ll let the photos speak for themselves.</description>

So we figured a two-week stay outta cover our family visit&amp;ndash; and our curiosity to see why it&amp;rsquo;s so attractive.</description>
