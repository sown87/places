<h2 id="the-newly-minted-city">The Newly Minted City</h2>
<p>We arrived in <a href="https://vineyardutah.org/" target="_blank">Vineyard, Utah</a> at the start of December 2020.  We came here to visit family living in the Salt Lake City area.  Too, a few friends we know spoke highly of SLC, and how it&rsquo;s becoming a popular destination for people looking for tech jobs.  So we figured a two-week stay outta cover our family visit&ndash; and our curiosity to see why it&rsquo;s so attractive.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure where the name &ldquo;Vineyard&rdquo; came from.   There weren&rsquo;t any vines that I could see, and Utah isn&rsquo;t exactly known as a grape-growing region.  Nevertheless, I won&rsquo;t chasten their founding fathers&ndash; perhaps they just wanted to have a &lsquo;bespoke&rsquo; name to draw people there.</p>
<p>Frankly, that hasn&rsquo;t been hard.  Vineyard sits in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salt_Lake_City_metropolitan_area" target="_blank">Salt Lake City Metropolitan Area</a>, adjacent to Orem and Provo.  And with so many people coming to SLT looking for housing, Vineyard as acquired the distinction as the <a href="https://www.sltrib.com/news/politics/2020/05/21/fastest-growing-city/" target="_blank">fastest growing city in the whole of Utah</a>.  It became an incorporated city just in 2016, and the conversion of a former steel production site into thousands of new <em>(and affordable)</em> housing units has spurred many dwelling-seekers to make Vineyard home.</p>
<p>Turns out, we stayed in an AirBnB apartment in one of those new housing developments.  While the apartment complex wasn&rsquo;t anything special, the unit itself was well stocked and nicely decorated&ndash; perhaps the nicest AirBnB we&rsquo;ve been in.</p>
<h2 id="rock-sky-and-ice">Rock, Sky and Ice</h2>
<p>The immediate thing that stood out to me&ndash; actually, to anyone&ndash; in the SLT metropolitan area are <strong>the MOUNTAINS</strong>.   I mean, the whole <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wasatch_Range" target="_blank">Wasatch mountain range</a> is <strong>RIGHT THERE</strong> in your face, running north-south along the entire metropolitan corridor.   It fascinated me to see urban and suburban streets, homes, businesses that ran right up to the base of the mountain, then <strong>BAM</strong> &ndash; sheer rock juts straight up a couple thousand feet.   You have to crane your neck up to see the top, it&rsquo;s so close.</p>
<p>That alone&ndash; the easy, direct access to hiking, skiing and outdoors&ndash; explains the SLT area popularity, IMHO.  I get it.  Sure, you gotta have jobs, and housing, and entertainment&ndash; but many places have those.   SLT has that&ndash; but it&rsquo;s also got this towering, dominating, authoritative, natural rock wonder of God sitting in your urban backyard everyday that other places can only envy.   From our apartment in Vineyard, I loved looking out toward the range, taking in the morning sun as it cast it&rsquo;s yellow-orange light over mountain peaks&hellip;</p>
<p><img src="/places/gallery/ut/ut_3.jpg" alt="sunpeek"></p>
<p>&hellip;that is, when it wasn&rsquo;t overcast and snowing.</p>
<p>Um, it snowed a fair bit.  And ice formed everywhere. Now, I love the snow, but our two weeks in an apartment&ndash; mind you, one that was on the third floor, with no elevator and an outside stairwell that was iced-over&ndash; took effort to navigate each day.  I slipped more than once.   And we experienced the joy of scraping our windshield and warming up our car for 15minutes whenever going out.  And since we didn&rsquo;t have an AWD or 4WD vehicle, a couple times the roads were too icy for our California-bred driving habits to overcome.  But Shondy and I laughed about it&ndash; just part of the experience!!</p>
<p><img src="/places/gallery/ut/ut_4.jpg" alt="snowparking"></p>
<h2 id="slip-sliding-with-the-byu-kids">Slip-Sliding with the BYU kids</h2>
<p>I love hiking.  One Sunday we caught a break in the weather, and I convinced Shondy we should stretch our legs a bit.  Heck with the snow&hellip; let&rsquo;s try to find a popular trail that wouldn&rsquo;t be too slippery.   So we set out for the <a href="https://www.provo.org/Home/Components/FacilityDirectory/FacilityDirectory/52/200" target="_blank">Rock Canyon Trail</a> that runs east out of Provo, UT.</p>
<p>It turned out to be a really fun time.  The trail narrows into a gorge that carry&rsquo;s on for miles, with rock face of the canyon hovering over us.  With snow around and tree&rsquo;s peeking through the snow cover, it was beautiful</p>
<p>But again&ndash; it <strong>WAS COLD</strong>. And despite my best planning, the trail was fairly icy. Shondy and I were garbed in four layers, with our grippiest, Vibram-outsoled shoes. Still we had to hold onto each other alot to keep from falling.  Don&rsquo;t think we even went two miles before turning around.</p>
<p>Yet I couldn&rsquo;t believe watching the other people who wandered the trail with us&ndash; namely, a whole bunch of BYU students.  I got the impression that taking a brisk walk in nature was a common BYU thing on a Sunday afternoon.  These kids seemed impervious to the temperature outside and the ice beneath their feet.   Shondy noticed more than one girl wearing VAN&rsquo;S sneakers. Some boys had on Oxford dress shoes.  Yet they just skipped right past us like it was nothing.  And they were wearing their Sunday church clothes&ndash; light sweater for girls or button up shirt for boys.</p>
<p>How could they not be cold?  Personally, I chalked it up to the fact that these kids, in packs of several boys and girls together, were in full flirt mode.  They musta been a little steamed up on the inside.  ;-)</p>
<h2 id="other-observations">Other Observations</h2>
<p>After that Rock Canyon experience, I broke down and bought some microspikes three days later.  I was done with slipping on ice.</p>
<p>We had a fabulous time seeing family, and wished that COVID would have made it easier to get out to the restaurants.  Hopefully another time.</p>
<p>It was December, and fresh fruit wasn&rsquo;t easy to come by.  But Shondy found <a href="https://www.crandallsfruitfarm.com/" target="_blank">this cool little apple orchard store</a> where she bought some really tasty apples.</p>
<p>One day we took a walk along Utah Lake, near our Vineyard apartment, when the sun came out.  Captured a great pic of what looks like two guys standing out on the lake.  And indeed they were&ndash; the lakeside was frozen.</p>
